## Installation

*Windows & Linux*

There should be no problems with the installation on Windows and Linux. Otherwise,
feel free to contact us.

*Mac/Apple Silicon*

Unfortunately, some of the "all_extras" dependencies do not work with Apple Silicon, 
later than and on M1 Chips. Especially numba is causing problems. Therefore, we recommend
installing the dependencies via the "macm1-requirements.txt" if you are using an Apple product. 

(Also, you may need to setup your python environment using python=3.9)

For more information, we refer to the [latest sktime documentation](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/installation.html).
